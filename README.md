# Better Twitch Cheermotes
Right now Cheermotes are saved as gifs with hardcoded transparencies to match chat. This is a problem, streams don't have solid colored backgrounds. If you want to have cheer emotes displayed in a bits cup or in a popups over your gameplay having this background is a problem.

At the moment this repo is mainly a proof of problem. If you edit `btcm.php` you can process additional cheermotes to get an approximate result.

Some cheermotes have better results like Cheer1, seen [here](https://zeekdageek.github.io/bettertwitchcheermotes/cheer1.html).

Some cheermotes have terrible results like PogChamp10000, seen [here](https://zeekdageek.github.io/bettertwitchcheermotes/pogchamp10000.html).
